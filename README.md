# Prime Solo Project: Reel Recipes

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Description

Duration: 2 Week Sprint

With a nearly endless collection of movies at our disposal, it can be hard to easily track current and past films that we want to watch. However, not anymore. Introducing the Weekend Movie Sagas app! This is a fully-functioning full-stack app primarily utilizing the power of React.js, Redux.js, and SQL to guide a user through a movie collection with a brief description for each, making it easier than ever to identify the perfect movie for your next watch party. 

## Installation

1. Create a database named `reel_recipes`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `reel_recipes` database
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Usage

1. The app opens on a "Home" page, which provides a variety of movie posters and their accompanying titles. Upon click of a movie poster, the user will be navigated to a "Details" page for the specific movie clicked. 

2. The "Details" page depicts the movie title, poster, genres, and a brief description from the database. Clicking the "Back" button navigates the user back to "Home" page, where another movie may be selected. 

## Built With

Visual Studio Code, Node/Nodemon, React.js, Redux.js, Passport.js, Axios, Material-UI, SQL, and Express
